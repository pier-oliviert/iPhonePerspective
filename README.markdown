# How to use
1. Copy the content of iphone.html (everything and including div.scene)
2. Add the /stylesheets /images and /javascripts content to your project
3. Profit!

Within div.scebe, you have a div with a classname "screen". You can add anything you want in there and it will be rendered within the iPhone. It will also follow the perspective changes.

# Todo
- I would like to add a fallback support for Firefox and IE. I'll probably add it soon.
- Fix the shadow (It's a bit off)
- Any other bug fix that would be required.

Thank you to [Tom Giannattasio][http://attasi.com/labs/ipad/] and [Dezine][http://re-dzine.net/demo/iphone4/]

I based my work around Tom's iPad and used Dezine's iPhone 4 as a reference. I also used some of his techniques for the speaker and camera lens.
